#Pygame with sockets#

This repo was created spontaneously for researchers like me to get started with such pointless ideas as **sockets with pygame**!
The engine was code is based on [DaFluffyPotato's](https://www.youtube.com/@DaFluffyPotato) videos, please go subscribe to him.

Right now, on version 1 the server works only in local network and can be used on 1 laptop only. Which easily fixed if you can input another player's ip. Go check it code.
